    Sometimes, we want to use some `f(x)` where `f` can be anything from a function that
    does nothing to a function that prints things. However, `x` can be a time consuming
    operation, so we don't always want x to be evaluated. Typically, loggers:

       logger.info(f"Doing something to n: {json.dumps(n)}")

    In the example above, it would be nice that the expression is not evaluated if
    the logger is a dummy logger.

    `lazy()` allows this to be rewritten as:

       logger.info(lazy(lambda: f"Doing something to n: {json.dumps(n)}"))
